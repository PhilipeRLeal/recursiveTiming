# recursiveTiming

This is a package that holds a single module, in which a custom Time checker is provided.

This class supports decoration operations just like the "timeit" does. The difference is that it allows 
one to define how the messages are printed in the console every time the decorator is invoqued.

Also, this class is capable of holding the previous time of the last run.


# An Example is provided within the examples repository, one that was extracted from
